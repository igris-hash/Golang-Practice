# Golang-Practice

Great! Let’s start your Go (Golang) learning journey from the ground up. Here’s a structured step-by-step plan we'll follow, and I’ll guide you through each stage with explanations, code examples, and practice ideas.

---

### **Step 1: Introduction to Go**
**Goals**:
- Understand what Go is and why it's used.
- Set up your Go environment.

**Topics**:
- What is Go?
- Installing Go
- Setting up `$GOPATH` and workspace
- Running your first Go program: `Hello, World!`

✅ *Your first task*:  
Install Go from the official website: [https://go.dev/dl/](https://go.dev/dl/)  
Then create and run this file:
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

---

### **Step 2: Go Language Basics**
**Goals**:
- Understand Go syntax and core features.

**Topics**:
- Variables and constants
- Data types (int, float, string, bool)
- Functions and multiple return values
- Control structures (if, switch, for)

✅ *Practice idea*:
Write a program that checks if a number is even or odd.

---

### **Step 3: Collections and Data Structures**
**Goals**:
- Use arrays, slices, maps.

**Topics**:
- Arrays vs slices
- Appending to slices
- Map creation and iteration

✅ *Practice idea*:
Build a simple phonebook using a `map[string]string`.

---

### **Step 4: Structs and Methods**
**Goals**:
- Create custom types using structs.
- Define methods for them.

**Topics**:
- Structs and field access
- Methods and value vs pointer receivers
- Encapsulation (exported/unexported fields)

✅ *Practice idea*:
Create a `User` struct and a method to display user details.

---

### **Step 5: Pointers and Memory Management**
**Goals**:
- Understand how pointers work in Go.

**Topics**:
- Pointers to values and structs
- Dereferencing and address-of operator
- `new` and `make` keywords

✅ *Practice idea*:
Write a function that swaps two numbers using pointers.

---

### **Step 6: Packages and Modules**
**Goals**:
- Organize code and reuse functionality.

**Topics**:
- Creating and using packages
- `go mod init` and `go build`
- Importing custom and standard packages

✅ *Practice idea*:
Split a program into multiple files and packages.

---

### **Step 7: Error Handling**
**Goals**:
- Learn Go’s idiomatic error handling.

**Topics**:
- Returning errors
- Custom error types
- `errors` and `fmt.Errorf`

✅ *Practice idea*:
Write a calculator that returns an error for division by zero.

---

### **Step 8: Concurrency in Go**
**Goals**:
- Understand goroutines and channels.

**Topics**:
- Goroutines
- Channels (unbuffered and buffered)
- `select` statement

✅ *Practice idea*:
Write a program that fetches data concurrently and combines the results.

---

### **Step 9: Interfaces and Polymorphism**
**Goals**:
- Use interfaces for abstraction.

**Topics**:
- Defining and implementing interfaces
- Empty interface and type assertions
- Interface composition

✅ *Practice idea*:
Create a `Shape` interface and implement it with `Circle` and `Rectangle`.

---

### **Step 10: Standard Library & File I/O**
**Goals**:
- Work with files and standard utilities.

**Topics**:
- `os` and `io/ioutil` packages
- Reading and writing files
- Parsing JSON with `encoding/json`

✅ *Practice idea*:
Write a program that loads a config from a JSON file.

---

### **Step 11: Testing and Benchmarking**
**Goals**:
- Test your Go code properly.

**Topics**:
- Writing tests with `_test.go` files
- Using `testing` package
- Writing benchmarks

✅ *Practice idea*:
Add tests to one of your previous projects.

---

### **Step 12: Building Real Applications**
**Goals**:
- Create CLI tools or web services.

**Topics**:
- HTTP servers with `net/http`
- RESTful APIs
- Working with databases (e.g. `database/sql` + MySQL/PostgreSQL)

✅ *Practice idea*:
Build a simple TODO app with RESTful API.
